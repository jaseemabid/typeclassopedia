** Typeclassopedia

Notes for the Haskell meetup talk, 17th Dec 2016

https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia

** Rough outline

*** What is a type class?

*** History

    I think Wadler's paper on ad-hoc polymorphism introduced type classes.
    Verify and add compelling examples

*** What problems does it solve?

    Comparisons with OOP interfaces might be useful here

*** The analogy problem

    You could have invented monads, buritto,

*** Closest approach in other languages

    Refer Crockford's talk for the js examples

*** The primitive type classes in GHC

    Typeclassopedia is not concerned about Eq and Ord and that makes sense.
    Might be useful to build the intuition.
